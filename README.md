# Momentum-Stacking-Resonant-Pulse-Fusion.Reactor
Uses layers of different states of matter & Sonoluminese in a tuned Resonant Cavity to create fusion reactions in the core! Works on "Stacked Ball Drop" experiment principle.

Liquid to gas to plasma layers are kept separate using rotation & centripetal force and/or electrostatic & magnetic fields. When spinning they make a disc in the center core which looks like a spiral galaxy. New fuel can be introduced at the edge and exhausted products (Helium, Carbon, Iron etc.) will be ejected along axis of disc, like a Quasar's Jets i.e. black hole accreting matter.

Cross sectionayers of molten & gas & plasma active materials look like an

Ionic Salts and "Molten Salt" with low gas solvability are ideal outer liquid layers as they can be influences with electromagnetic fields and keep most of the gas from dissolving.

Sonoluminese is used to sustain the reaction in a pulsing manner, while Microwave & or laser energy, tuned to be transparent to outer layers can be used to heat the plasma and initiate the fusion.

Pused electrostatics like a capacitor plate with the plasma acting as the other plate can also be used to add momentum pulses to the core. We defer to research from the cold fusion realm on "superwave" fractals for insight. Those were used to compress palladium latticed but we want to use the same waveform for ionic liquids & plasma.

Once self sustaining it creates a near continuous, pulsed heat flow with the surface area & radius of the reaction vessel determining the outer surface wall temperature according to Inverse Square law.

All radiation will be absorbed by inner layers. And if convection is kept to a minimum, meaning layer boundaries are smooth & laminar, in a feedback look controlled by a computer & sensors by dynamically modulating the electromagnetic fields, thus only form if heat transfer is Conduction. This is very different from Tokamak since we can use lower temperature materials on the hull!

Credits: Kevin Davies inspired all of this with his stories of Coulter Smithing's device, Ashton Forbes was a key researcher on ",Field Reverse Configuration" including Helion Energy's colliding Torus reactor, Lockheed Martin compact fusion reactor experiment, coupled with pre existing knowledge on the French 1990s Sonoluminese nuclear reaction experiment, and other disclosure on "free energy" & fusion tech, especially from Gordon Duff. Also John Lear's disclosure on U.S. nuclear submarines having working fusion designs. Also "cold fusion" LENR/LANR lattice assisted nuclear reactions and "Superwave" fractal sune wave impulse experiments. As far as we know this design is novel and has not been revealed publicly - whether or not aspects of it have & are being used in secret.
