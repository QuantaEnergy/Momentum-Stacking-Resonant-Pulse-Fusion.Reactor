# Momentum-Stacking-Resonant-Pulse-Fusion.Reactor
Uses layers of different states of matter &amp; Sonoluminese in a tuned Resonant Cavity to create fusion reactions in the core! Works on "Stacked Ball Drop" experiment principle. Liquid to gas to plasma layers are kept separate using to create fusion
